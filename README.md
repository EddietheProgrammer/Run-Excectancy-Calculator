# Run-Excectancy-Calculator
This calculates how effective a pitcher is in preventing runs. 
I know the code has some bugs in it, but I am working on making it foolproof. If anyone has any suggestions it would be greatly appreciated. 
It also has some dry code, but I would be open to see if there are any effiecient ways that work.
Use the Driver and Constructor files together.
